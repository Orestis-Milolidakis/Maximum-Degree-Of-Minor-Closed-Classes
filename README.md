# Maximum-Degree-Of-Minor-Closed-Classes

This is a draft of the paper we are writing with professors Agelos Georgakopoulos and David Wood. We do not intend to add any new material or proofs, but we are making it easier to read.

It is easy to see that every planar graph is a minor of another planar graph
of maximum degree 3. Georgakopoulos proved that every finite K5-minor
free graph is a minor of another K5-minor-free graph of maximum degree
22, and inquired if this is smallest possible.
This motivates the following generalization: Let C be a minor-closed class.
What is the minimum k such that any graph in C is a minor of a graph
in C of maximum degree k? Denote the minimum by ∆(C) and set it to
be ∞ if no such k exists.
A graph class is proper if it does not contain all graphs. We prove that
a minor-closed class C excludes an apex graph if and only if there ex-
ists a proper minor-closed superclass C′ of C with ∆(C′) = 3. This
complements a list of 5 other characterizations of the minor-closed classes
excluding an apex graph by Dujmovic, Morin and Wood.
